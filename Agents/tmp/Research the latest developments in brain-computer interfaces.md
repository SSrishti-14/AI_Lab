Okay, I will conduct a thorough investigation into the latest developments in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). I will start by running three distinct searches to gather comprehensive information, analyze and cross-reference the sources, and then structure the report.


Running:
 - search_exa(query=latest developments in brain-computer interfaces, num_results=5.0)
 - search_exa(query=recent breakthroughs in BCI technology, num_results=5.0)
 - search_exa(query=clinical trials brain-computer interfaces, num_results=5.0)

Okay, I have run three searches to gather information on the latest developments in brain-computer interfaces. Now I will analyze the results and create a report.
